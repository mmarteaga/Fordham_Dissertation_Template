# Fordham_Dissertation_Template

Hello!

This is an (UNOFFICIAL) template for the dissertation proposed to Fordham University. This serves as the groundwork for my own dissertation which I compile on Overleaf. The package contains the template files which mostly conforms with the rules set by Fordham University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as of November 2021.

This template runs off the main Fordham University Dissertation (FUDIS) file, "FUDIS-00-main.tex", itself an amalgamation of  formatting (layout, colors, margins, title specifications, etc) from the "FUDIS-00-options.sty" style file. The 'main' file must be compiled with LaTeX to create the document. The rest of the TeX files contain the formatting for the other sections of the dissertation, themselves added in the 'main' file by the input command. 

I assume the user knows enough LaTeX, bibTeX, and all the packages I have used in order to navigate these files and welcome comments to improving said template. I urge you to check with Fordham's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences page in regards to the particular requirements for dissertations during your own journey. 

I hope this template proves useful to someone, anyone, in need of guidance for taking on what seems, at first, an insurmountable task. But you are here, having gone through numerous obstacles, writing your dissertation. In the end, you proved that they were all conquerable heights, one step at a time.
